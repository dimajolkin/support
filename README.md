The package includes attributes, helpers, factories, interfaces, interceptors, 
etc. to enhance the developer experience when using the [Temporal PHP SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php).

## Usage

### Factories

The package provides factories to create Activity and Worker stubs in a more convenient way.
With these factories, there is less code because all nested options are moved to the parameters of one method.

Use the `\Temporal\Support\Factory\ActivityStub` factory to create an Activity stub:

```php
use \Temporal\Support\Factory\ActivityStub;

#[\Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowInterface]
class HelloWorkflow {
    #[\Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowMethod]
    public function run(string $user) {
        yield ActivityStub::activity(
            class: UserService::class,
            startToCloseTimeout: 60,
            retryAttempts: 5,
        )->getContactEmail($user)->then(
            fn (string $email) => ActivityStub::activity(
                class: HelloService::class,
                startToCloseTimeout: '10 minutes',
                retryAttempts: 5,
            )->sendHelloEmail($user, $email),
        );
    }
}
```

Use the `\Temporal\Support\Factory\WorkflowStub` factory to create a Workflow stub in a client scope:

```php
use \Temporal\Support\Factory\WorkflowStub;
/**
 * @var \Temporal\Client\WorkflowClient $client
 */
$stub = WorkflowStub::workflow($client, HelloWorkflow::class, executionTimeout: '1 day');
$run = $client->start($stub, 'User');
// ...
```

Or create a Child Workflow stub in a workflow scope:

```php
use \Temporal\Support\Factory\WorkflowStub;

#[\Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowInterface]
class RegisterWorkflow {
    #[\Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowMethod]
    public function run(string $user) {
        yield \Temporal\Promise::all([
            WorkflowStub::childWorkflow(GreetingWorkflow::class, executionTimeout: '1 hour')->greet($user),
            WorkflowStub::childWorkflow(SubscribeNewsWorkflow::class, executionTimeout: '10 minutes')->subscribe($user),
            WorkflowStub::childWorkflow(PrepareUserSpaceWorkflow::class, executionTimeout: '1 hour')->handle($user),
        ])->then(
            // Suppress failures
            onRejected: static fn () => null,
        );

        // ...
    }
}
```

### Attributes

Attributes can be used on Workflow or Activity definitions to set default stub options.

```php
#[\Temporal\Support\Attribute\TaskQueue('my-task-queue')]
#[\Temporal\Support\Attribute\RetryPolicy(attempts: 5)]
#[WorkflowInterface]
interface HelloWorkflow {
    #[WorkflowMethod]
    public function greet(string $name);
}

$stub = \Temporal\Support\Factory\WorkflowStub::workflow($client, HelloWorkflow::class);

// TaskQueue is now set to 'my-task-queue' and RetryPolicy to 5 attempts
$stub->greet('User');

// You can override the default options
$stub = \Temporal\Support\Factory\WorkflowStub::workflow(
    $client,
    HelloWorkflow::class,
    taskQueue: 'another-task-queue',
    retryAttempts: 1,
)->greet('User');
```

> [!NOTE]
> Attributes will work only if you use the Activity and Worker factories from this package.  

> [!WARNING]
> Use attributes on the definitions that you use in factories.
> So, if you separate interfaces and implementation, apply attributes to the interfaces.


### VirtualPromise interface

Every time we use `yield` in a Workflow to wait for an action to complete, a Promise is actually yielded.
At this point, the IDE and static analyzer usually get lost in type definitions,
and we experience difficulties and inconveniences because of this.
However, if the Promise interface had the `@yield` annotation,
we could explain to the IDE what type of value we expect to be sent back into the generator from the coroutine.
Since ReactPHP [isn't yet planning](https://github.com/orgs/reactphp/discussions/536)
to add the `@yield` annotation to their promises
(Temporal PHP uses ReactPHP promises),
we suggest using our solution for typing - `VirtualPromise`.

```php
use Temporal\Support\VirtualPromise;

#[\Temporal\Activity\ActivityInterface]
class HelloService {
    /**
     * @param non-empty-string $name
     *
     * @return VirtualPromise<non-empty-string>
     */
    public function greet(string $name) {
        // ...
    }
}

#[\Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowInterface]
class WorkflowClass {
    #[\Temporal\Workflow\WorkflowMethod]
    public function run(string $name) {
        $activity = \Temporal\Support\Factory\ActivityStub::activity(HelloService::class);

        // IDE will know that $name is a non-empty-string
        $name = yield $activity->greet($name);
        // ...
    }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> don't implement the `VirtualPromise` interface yourself, use it only as a type hint.

> [!NOTE]
> PHPStorm and Psalm can handle the `@yield` annotation, but PHPStan can't yet ([issue](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/issues/4245)).
